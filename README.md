# chat-socketio

Working chat based on NodeJS, Socket.io and ExpressJS. Uses Pug instead of Jade.

Based on the Krasimir Tsonev's tutorial: [Real Time Chat With NodeJS, Socket.io and ExpressJS](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/real-time-chat-with-nodejs-socketio-and-expressjs--net-31708)

I have changed some bits of the code from the article to make it 100% working.

Enjoy!
